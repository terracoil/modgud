# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting key architectural decisions for the modgud project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs are short documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help future developers understand why certain design choices were made.

## ADR Index

| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|

| [ADR-003](./ADR-003-registry-system-architecture.md) | Registry System Architecture | Accepted | 2025-10-26 |

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this standard format:

- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Context**: What problem are we solving and why?
- **Decision**: What architectural decision was made?
- **Consequences**: What are the positive and negative impacts?
- **Alternatives Considered**: What other options were evaluated?

## Contributing
