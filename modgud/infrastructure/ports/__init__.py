Infrastructure layer ports - contracts for surface layer.

These ports define the contracts that infrastructure services implement
for use by the surface layer. Following the Dependency Inversion Principle,
infrastructure (inner layer) defines what services it provides, and surface
(outer layer) depends on these contracts.
