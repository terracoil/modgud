Infrastructure layer ports - contracts for application layer.

These ports define the contracts that infrastructure services implement
for use by the application layer. Following the Dependency Inversion Principle,
infrastructure (inner layer) defines what services it provides, and application
(outer layer) depends on these contracts.
