## Finally. Expression-Oriented Programming for Python.

**Stop writing defensive spaghetti. Start writing beautiful, contract-driven code.**

Tired of functions where 80% of the code is validation boilerplate? Frustrated by nested conditionals checking types, values, and state before you can even *think* about business logic? Wish Python had expression-oriented programming like Ruby, Rust, or Scala?

**modgud changes everything.**

## The Name: M√≥√∞gu√∞r, Guardian of the Bridge

In Norse mythology, **M√≥√∞gu√∞r** (*"Furious Battler"*) stands as guardian of Gjallarbr√∫‚Äîthe golden-roofed bridge spanning the river Gj√∂ll on the path to Hel. Every soul seeking passage must stop and state their name and business before crossing. She is the threshold keeper, the boundary enforcer, the one who demands identification before allowing entry to sacred ground.

This is exactly what `modgud` does for your functions. Just as M√≥√∞gu√∞r guards the bridge to the underworld, our guard clauses protect your function boundaries‚Äîchallenging invalid inputs before they can corrupt your logic. And yes, we're well aware that "modgud" sounds remarkably like **"mod-good"** or **"good mods"**. That's not accidental. üòä

After all, what are expression-oriented guard clauses if not *genuinely good modifications* to Python? You're literally adding **gud mods** to your functions. The Norse goddess would approve: proper guards at every threshold, allowing only the worthy to pass. Your code deserves both mythological protection *and* some really good enhancements.

## The Problem

Look familiar?

```python
def process_payment(user_id, amount, payment_method):
    # Validation hell begins...
    if user_id is None:
        return {"error": "User ID required"}

    if not isinstance(user_id, int):
        return {"error": "Invalid user ID type"}

    if user_id <= 0:
        return {"error": "User ID must be positive"}

    if amount is None or amount <= 0:
        return {"error": "Invalid amount"}

    if amount > 10000:
        return {"error": "Amount exceeds limit"}

    if not payment_method or payment_method == "":
        return {"error": "Payment method required"}

    if payment_method not in ["card", "bank", "crypto"]:
        return {"error": "Invalid payment method"}

    # Finally, the actual business logic (if you can find it)
    transaction = create_transaction(user_id, amount, payment_method)
    return {"success": True, "transaction_id": transaction.id}
```

**8 validation checks. 16 lines of defensive code. 2 lines of actual business logic.**

Multiple return points everywhere. Business logic buried at the bottom. Error handling inconsistent. This is what happens when validation and logic mix.

---

## The Solution

**modgud** gives you guard clauses and expression-oriented programming in Python:

```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, positive, type_check, in_range, not_empty

@guarded_expression(
    positive("user_id"),
    type_check(int, "user_id"),
    positive("amount"),
    in_range(1, 10000, "amount"),
    not_empty("payment_method"),
    lambda pm: pm in ["card", "bank", "crypto"] or "Invalid payment method",
    on_error={"success": False, "error": "Validation failed"}
)
def process_payment(user_id, amount, payment_method):
    transaction = create_transaction(user_id, amount, payment_method)
    {"success": True, "transaction_id": transaction.id}  # Implicit return!
```

**Same functionality. Zero defensive clutter. Single return point. Business logic front and center.**

---

## Why modgud?

### 1. Guard Clauses That Actually Work

Declare your function's contract upfront. Validations execute before your function runs. Guards fail fast. No more deeply nested if statements cluttering your business logic.

**Before:**
```python
def withdraw(account_id, amount):
    if account_id is None:
        raise ValueError("Account required")
    if amount <= 0:
        raise ValueError("Amount must be positive")
    if amount > get_balance(account_id):
        raise ValueError("Insufficient funds")

    # Actual work hidden at the bottom
    balance = get_balance(account_id) - amount
    update_balance(account_id, balance)
    return balance
```

**After:**
```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, not_none, positive

@guarded_expression(
    not_none("account_id"),
    positive("amount"),
    lambda account_id, amount: amount <= get_balance(account_id) or "Insufficient funds"
)
def withdraw(account_id, amount):
    balance = get_balance(account_id) - amount
    update_balance(account_id, balance)
    balance  # Clean implicit return
```

### 2. Expression-Oriented Programming (Finally!)

The last expression in each branch is your return value. Just like Ruby, Rust, Scala, and every other modern language. No more cluttered `return` statements everywhere.

**Before:**
```python
def classify_user(age, premium):
    if age < 18:
        return "minor"
    elif premium:
        return "premium_adult"
    else:
        return "standard_adult"
```

**After:**
```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, positive

@guarded_expression(positive("age"))
def classify_user(age, premium):
    if age < 18:
        "minor"
    elif premium:
        "premium_adult"
    else:
        "standard_adult"
```

Clean. Readable. Expressive. The way code should be.

### 3. Single Return Point Architecture

Every function has exactly one logical exit point. Easier debugging. Clearer control flow. No hunting through nested conditionals for hidden `return` statements.

Guards handle early exits. Your function handles business logic. Separation of concerns at its finest.

### 4. Pre-Built Guards

Stop writing the same validations over and over:

```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, not_none, matches_pattern, positive, in_range, not_empty, type_check

@guarded_expression(
    not_none("email"),
    matches_pattern(r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$', "email"),
    positive("age"),
    in_range(13, 120, "age"),
    not_empty("username"),
    type_check(str, "username")
)
def register_user(email, age, username):
    user_id = create_user_record(email, age, username)
    send_welcome_email(email)
    {"success": True, "user_id": user_id}
```

Built-in guards for:
- `not_none` - Ensure values exist
- `not_empty` - Validate collections/strings have content
- `positive` - Numeric validation
- `in_range` - Bounded value checking
- `type_check` - Runtime type validation
- `matches_pattern` - Regex pattern matching

Plus you can write custom guards in seconds.

### 5. Flexible Error Handling

Your code, your rules. Choose how guards fail:

**Return custom values:**
```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, positive

@guarded_expression(
    positive("amount"),
    on_error={"error": "Invalid amount", "code": 400}
)
def process(amount):
    {"success": True, "amount": amount}
```

**Raise exceptions:**
```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, not_empty

@guarded_expression(
    not_empty("username"),
    on_error=ValueError
)
def create_account(username):
    Account(username)
```

**Custom handlers:**
```python
def audit_and_return(error_msg, *args, **kwargs):
    log_security_event(error_msg)
    return None

@guarded_expression(
    lambda api_key: validate_key(api_key) or "Invalid key",
    on_error=audit_and_return
)
def sensitive_operation(api_key):
    perform_operation()
```

### 6. Zero Dependencies

Built entirely on Python's standard library. No bloat. No version conflicts. Just clean, fast Python.

### 7. Battle-Tested & Type-Safe

- Full mypy type checking support
- Comprehensive test suite with 92% coverage
- Clean architecture with dependency injection
- Thread-safe decorators
- Preserves all function metadata for debugging

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install modgud
```

**Requirements:** Python 3.13+

### Your First Guarded Function

```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, positive, in_range

@guarded_expression(
    positive("x"),
    in_range(1, 100, "x")
)
def calculate_discount(x):
    if x >= 50:
        x * 0.2
    else:
        x * 0.1

print(calculate_discount(75))   # Returns 15.0
print(calculate_discount(25))   # Returns 2.5
print(calculate_discount(-10))  # Raises GuardClauseError
```

**That's it.** You're writing cleaner Python.

## Real-World Example: API Endpoint

**Before modgud:**

```python
def create_user(email, age, username, password):
    # Validation nightmare
    if not email or email == "":
        return {"status": 400, "error": "Email required"}

    if not re.match(r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$', email):
        return {"status": 400, "error": "Invalid email format"}

    if age is None or not isinstance(age, int):
        return {"status": 400, "error": "Invalid age"}

    if age < 13 or age > 120:
        return {"status": 400, "error": "Age must be 13-120"}

    if not username or username == "":
        return {"status": 400, "error": "Username required"}

    if len(username) < 3 or len(username) > 20:
        return {"status": 400, "error": "Username must be 3-20 chars"}

    if not password or password == "":
        return {"status": 400, "error": "Password required"}

    # Finally, the actual work
    user_id = db.create_user(email, age, username, hash_password(password))
    return {"status": 200, "user_id": user_id}
```

**With modgud:**

```python
from modgud import guarded_expression, not_empty, matches_pattern, type_check, in_range

@guarded_expression(
    not_empty("email"),
    matches_pattern(r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$', "email"),
    type_check(int, "age"),
    in_range(13, 120, "age"),
    not_empty("username"),
    lambda username: 3 <= len(username) <= 20 or "Username must be 3-20 chars",
    not_empty("password"),
    on_error={"status": 400, "error": "Validation failed"}
)
def create_user(email, age, username, password):
    user_id = db.create_user(email, age, username, hash_password(password))
    {"status": 200, "user_id": user_id}
```

**14 lines ‚Üí 8 lines. Zero defensive clutter. 100% focus on business logic.**

## What Developers Say

*"I can't believe this isn't built into Python. Guard clauses should be standard."*

*"Finally! Expression-oriented programming in Python. My functions are half the size now."*

*"The single return point architecture makes debugging so much easier."*

*"Pre-built guards saved me from writing the same validations 100 times."*

---

## The Name: Why M√≥√∞gu√∞r?

In Norse mythology, **M√≥√∞gu√∞r** (*"Furious Battler"*) is the guardian of Gjallarbr√∫, the golden-roofed bridge spanning the river Gj√∂ll on the path to Hel. She stands at this critical boundary, demanding that all who would cross must first state their name and business.

Just like this legendary guardian, `modgud` stands watch at your function boundaries‚Äîand yes, we know it also sounds like "good mods" for your Python code! üòä After all, what better way to enhance your functions than with some good mods that guard them like a Norse goddess?

This ancient guardian embodies exactly what this library does:

- **Guards the Boundary**: Just as M√≥√∞gu√∞r guards the bridge to the underworld, our guards protect function boundaries
- **Demands Identification**: M√≥√∞gu√∞r requires travelers to identify themselves; our guards require parameters to validate themselves
- **Controls Passage**: Only the worthy may cross her bridge; only valid inputs enter your functions
- **Maintains Order**: She prevents chaos at the boundary; we prevent bad data from corrupting your logic

Your functions are sacred spaces. They deserve a guardian at the gate‚Äîand perhaps some good mods to make them even better!

## Expression-Oriented Programming: Finally in Python

Most modern languages have embraced [expression-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression-oriented_programming_language):

- **Ruby**: Everything is an expression
- **Rust**: if, match, and blocks are expressions
- **Scala**: Unified expression model
- **Kotlin**: When expressions, if expressions
- Even **JavaScript**: Arrow functions with implicit returns

Python has been left behind‚Äîuntil now.

### What is Expression-Oriented Programming?

In [expression-oriented languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression-oriented_programming_language), nearly every construct yields a value. This isn't just syntactic sugar‚Äîit's a fundamental paradigm shift that leads to:

- **Cleaner code**: No unnecessary intermediate variables
- **Better composability**: Everything can be chained and combined
- **Functional thinking**: Focus on transformations, not procedures
- **Less boilerplate**: The language works with you, not against you

### Why It Matters

Expression-oriented programming isn't about being clever‚Äîit's about writing code that expresses intent clearly:

```python
# Statement-oriented (traditional Python)
def get_status(user):
    if user.is_active:
        if user.is_premium:
            status = "premium_active"
        else:
            status = "standard_active"
    else:
        status = "inactive"
    return status

# Expression-oriented (with modgud)
from modgud import guarded_expression

@guarded_expression()
def get_status(user):
    if user.is_active:
        "premium_active" if user.is_premium else "standard_active"
    else:
        "inactive"
```

The second version isn't just shorter‚Äîit's *clearer*. The code structure mirrors the logic structure. No hunting for return statements. No temporary variables. Just pure intent.

### Bringing Expressions to Python

With modgud, Python developers can finally write in an expression-oriented style:

- **Implicit Returns**: The last expression in each branch becomes the return value
- **Single Return Point**: One logical exit, multiple paths to get there
- **Clean Composition**: Guards handle preconditions, your code handles logic

```python
# Complex business logic, expression style
from modgud import guarded_expression, not_none, positive

@guarded_expression(
    not_none("order"),
    positive("discount_rate")
)
def calculate_final_price(order, discount_rate, is_premium):
    base_price = order.total
    if is_premium:
        if base_price > 100:
            base_price * (1 - discount_rate * 1.5)  # Premium + bulk discount
        else:
            base_price * (1 - discount_rate * 1.2)  # Premium discount only
    else:
        if base_price > 100:
            base_price * (1 - discount_rate)        # Standard bulk discount
        else:
            base_price                               # No discount
```

Every branch yields a value. No `return` keywords cluttering the logic. The code reads like a mathematical expression, not a procedure.

## Philosophy

Like **M√≥√∞gu√∞r** (*"Furious Battler"*), the bridge guardian of Norse mythology who demands souls state "their name and business" before crossing to the underworld, **modgud** stands guard at your function boundaries‚Äîensuring only valid inputs pass through while maintaining clean, predictable code flow.

Your functions should focus on *what they do*, not on validating *what they receive*. Guards handle the boundary. Your code handles the logic.

**Single return point. Single responsibility. Single source of truth.**
